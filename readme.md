# TIC TAC TOE

This is a web app the simulates tic tac toe. This app was built with just javascript, html and css.

The javascript instantiates a game board (handles the logic of placing marks and checking for win/draw conditions) and attaches that board to a game instance. The game instance ties board to the player data and keeps track of winners. The game instance is rendered dynamically to the DOM via a display controller.
